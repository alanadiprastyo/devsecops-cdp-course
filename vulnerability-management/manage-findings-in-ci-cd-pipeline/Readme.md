Automated Results Upload in GitLab
================================================

Use script(s) to automatically push security findings to Vulnerability Management system from CI/CD
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, you will learn how to automatically manage security issues using vulnerability management systems like Defect Dojo.

A simple CI/CD pipeline
----------

Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.

```
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
```

We see four jobs in this pipeline, a build job, a test job, a integration job, and a prod job.

As a security engineer, I do not care what they are doing as part of these jobs. Why? Imagine having to learn every build/testing tool used by your DevOps team. It will be a nightmare! Instead, rely on the DevOps team for help.

Let’s log into GitLab using the following details and execute this pipeline.

> access your gitlab

Next, we need to create a CI/CD pipeline by replacing the .gitlab-ci.yml file content with the above CI script. Click on the Edit button to replace the content (use Control+A and Control+V).

Save changes to the file using the Commit changes button.


Verify the pipeline run
----------

As soon as a change is made to the repository, the pipeline starts executing the jobs.

We can see the results of this pipeline by visiting https://gitlab-ce-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/pipelines.

Click on the appropriate job name to see the output.

This exercise uses three machines behind the scenes, you already know about Gitlab CI. You will find details about the other two machines below.

Machine(s) access
----------
- Dojo URL : dojo-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/
- Username: root
- Password: pdso-training
> 
- Prod URL : prod-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

> You will use the prod machine in the next exercise (not the below one).

Upload script
----------

You can use the upload-results.py script from https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/-/snippets/3/raw

Exercise
----------

We will use the bandit tool to scan a repository for security issues and upload the tool’s output to DefectDojo in CI/CD pipeline.

1. Read the [bandit documentation](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/tree/master/bandit)
2. Embed bandit in build stage and save the output as JSON file
3. Where should you upload the upload-results.py file for the fully automated pipeline to work?
4. Remember to follow all best practices while adding the baseline scan to CI/CD pipeline

Once you are done, please do not forget to share the pipeline script with our staff.

> Please try to do this exercise without looking at the solution on the next page.

Embed Bandit and upload script in CI/CD pipeline
----------

As discussed in the Static Analysis using Bandit exercise, we can embed the Bandit tool in our CI/CD pipeline. However, you need to run the command manually before you embed this SAST tool in the pipeline.

```
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

sast:
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - apk add py-pip
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/bandit  # Download bandit docker container
    - docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/bandit -r /src -f json -o /src/bandit-output.json
  after_script:
    - python3 upload-results.py --host $DOJO_HOST --api_key $DOJO_API_TOKEN --engagement_id 1 --product_id 1 --lead_id 1 --environment "Production" --result_file bandit-output.json --scanner "Bandit Scan"
  artifacts:
    paths: [bandit-output.json]
    when: always

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
```

Before we commit this file to the repository, We need to set DOJO_HOST and DOJO_API_TOKEN under secrets variables by visiting the following URL

Gitlab Variables URL: https://gitlab-ce-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/-/settings/ci_cd

- Key: DOJO_HOST
- Value: dojo-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training
>
- Key: DOJO_API_TOKEN
- Value: Find it at https://dojo-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/api/key-v2

Once you’re done with the variables, you can commit the .gitlab-ci.yml file and see the results of this pipeline by visiting https://gitlab-ce-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/pipelines.

Click on the appropriate job name to see the output.

The pipeline will fail because the job sast didn’t succeed. If you see the job’s output, you will realize that we didn’t upload the upload-results.py file into the repo and the CI system failed the build as it couldn’t find it in the repository.

Let’s move to the next page to add this script to the repository via the Git command line. Of course, we will perform these steps from DevSecOps Box.

Upload python script in CI/CD pipeline
----------

Before we can push the upload-results.py file to the repo, we need to set up the git command line.

Initial git setup
----------

To work with git repositories, we first need to set up a username and email. We can use git config commands to set it up

Download/clone/copy the repository
----------

We can use the git clone command to download the django.nv git repository to our local machine.

```
git clone http://root:pdso-training@gitlab-ce-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv.git
```

By cloning the above repository, we created a local copy of the remote repository.

Lets cd into this repository to explore its content.

```
cd django-nv
```

Add a file to the repository
-----------

First, lets download the upload-results.py script using the following curl command.

```
curl https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/-/snippets/3/raw -o upload-results.py
git add upload-results.py
git commit -m "Add upload-results.py file"
```

Push the changes to the repository
----------

Since git is a decentralized source code management system, all changes live in your local git repository till you push them to the server. Think it like this git was meant to run even when you do not have internet connectivity, on flights, vessels or in a jungle somewhere__.

We have internet connectivity, lets push it to the remote git repository using the git push command.

```
git push origin master
```

As discussed earlier, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline. We can see the result of this change in the pipeline tab of Gitlab CI at https://gitlab-ce-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/pipelines.

There you have it. Every time a developer makes a change, our SAST scanner will run and will automatically upload the results to the vulnerability management system.

You can verify the issues were uploaded successfully by visiting the dojo website.

Exercise: Upload ZAP results to Defect Dojo Automatically via CI/CD pipeline.
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will use the upload-results.py script to upload the ZAP scan results to the Defect Dojo in CI/CD pipeline.

1. Scan the production machine https://prod-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training with the help of the ZAP docker image
2. Store the ZAP scan results in a file and upload the security issues to Defect Dojo
3. Embed this upload script as part of the ZAP Scan in the CI/CD pipeline using after_script task
